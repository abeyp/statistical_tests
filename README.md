# Paper Replication of Hypothesis Testing on Web-based Positive Psychology Interventions

**Project**

The authors of *Web-based positive psychology interventions: A reexamination of effectiveness.* released their clean datasets of happiness and depression scores in a randomly controlled experiment of positivie psychology interventions over time. I took this as an oppurtunity to replicate the statistical findings in the paper using R to reproduce conclusions and casual inference.

**R Code**
* Best Viewed with plots here! https://rpubs.com/abeyp/1037564
* Hypothesis Testing code can be viewed here: 
* ANOVA code replication here: 

**Goal**

1. Replicate various hypothesis testing methods for no difference between participants who completed all assessments vs participants who did not complete all assessments.
2. Perform 4x6 Mixed Design ANOVA on Intervention x Occassion of Participants who completed all 6 assessment checkpoints.
